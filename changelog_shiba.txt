Build type: Weekly
Device: Google Pixel 8 ( Shiba )
Device maintainer: Matt Filetto (Albinoman887)
Release Version : v4.2.4 2024-03-07

Highlights & Device Specific Changes:
   * Disabled PixelDisplayServices in favor of PixelParts while keeping Pixel Thermometer Functional
   * New Custom Lockscreen Clock Styles
   * Fixed Realme UI Volume Panel Style causing SystemUI crash
   * Added option to make lift to wake and/or tap-to-wake bring up AmbientDisplay on first tap, wake on 2nd
   * Fixed bugs with tap to doze implementation previously mentioned.
   * Made the "Show Ambient" Toggles dependent on the corsopnding tap-to-wake/lift-to-wake toggle also being enabled
   * Further debugged the CPU Freq spike bug and isolated it down to one commit adjusting uclamp params for loading
     modules. This was just a "optimization" change so I have reverted it and submitted the patch upstream to CrDroid.
